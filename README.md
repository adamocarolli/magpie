# Magpie

**Magpie** is a dashboard in your console that reminds you to take good care of yourself and encourage you throughout the day. Unlike its namesake Magpie aims at being as unobtrusive as possible.

The initial planned feature is to display on the dashboard:
- A stream of Tweets that remind you to take breaks, drink water and take care of yourself.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/adamocarolli/magpie
```

## Acknowledgements
 - This project is loosely inspired by [tiny-care-terminal](https://github.com/notwaldorf/tiny-care-terminal) a more established console dashboard written in JavaScript. The main difference here is we're writing in Golang because Systems Engineers need care too! And may want to fork and modify the library in a language they may be more familiar with.
